experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .
experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california
institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is
trip position .

an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .
the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-
layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a
uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .
the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was
investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10
regardless of the amount of air injected .
a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds
numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for
incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective
reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 .

application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by

that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature
is not required .  a key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating
components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .
the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of
pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good
agreement with the experimentally measured and independently

in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow
carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general

experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by
rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to
the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of
the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference
infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that
the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent
boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of
this assumption and of the transformations was established for several

theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated

the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a
dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibrium .
two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
made .
for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are
considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .
a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is
involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .
it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by
a simple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .

inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies .
at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much
larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy
contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight
direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many
times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly
analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave
found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a
flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this
similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution
is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a
hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .
energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,
where for a two-dimensional body and for a
body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some
distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details
of the nose geometry .
by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures
generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures
induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the
corresponding distance is given by .  (here
is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge
thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are
replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous
interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt-
nosed slender body only for relatively low values of .
however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is

photo-thermoelastic investigation of transient thermal
stresses in a multiweb wing structure .
photothermoelastic experiments were performed on a long
multiweb wing model for which a theoretical analysis is available in
the literature .  the experimental procedures utilized to simulate
the conditions prescribed in the theory are fully described .
correlation of theory and experiment in terms of dimensionless
temperature, stress, time, and biot number revealed that the
theory predicted values higher than the experimentally observed
maximum thermal stresses at the center of the web .  detailed
temperature measurements in the flange suggested that the major
source of this discrepancy can be traced to the one-dimensional
heat conduction analysis of the flange employed in the theory .

the dynamic motion of a missile descending through
the atmosphere .
a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,
the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through
the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a
set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a
set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion
of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation
allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner
analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass
system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring
constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be
solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an
additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete
oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function
of the maximum angle of attack at that time .
this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a
missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant
speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .

the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics .
the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting
fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written
down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to
aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable
significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .
dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions
of flight in the atmosphere .
some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-
gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow
with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in
constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is
characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these
are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to
the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel .
it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from
magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to
justify the considerable research and engineering development
that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems
are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact
with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,
and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .

constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .
in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant
temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .

stagnation point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow .
the purpose of this paper is to present a method of calculation
devised to yield all the important information on the symmetric
inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnation point region of a blunt
body .  the problem is the same as that considered by hayes
who used a slightly different approach .  it is demonstrated that
hayes' results are valid in the stagnation point region and can
hence be considered a basis for constructing less restricted
solutions .
equations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment
distance, and vorticity .  the values of shock detachment
distance and body pressure coefficient are compared with
experimental data for spheres .  the pressure comparison shows that
the results of hayes and the theory presented herein represent a
better approximation than the newtonian impact theory for
hypersonic mach numbers .
in conclusion, the possibility of refinements to this analysis is
discussed .
